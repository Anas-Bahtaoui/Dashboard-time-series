## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts traditional hypothesis testing.

We hope to simplify EDA on projects with a time component. Our tool helps answering several questions about sequential data:
- Are there consistent patterns?
- Is there a significant trend?
- Is seasonality important?
- Is there evidence of the presence of business cycles?
- Are there any outliers in the data that need to be explained by those with expert knowledge?
- How strong are the relationships among the variables available for analysis?
